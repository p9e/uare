    Making room
    for worlds to be born, new life to arise,
    the fount of existence to be tapped,
    the center of things to become vital again.
    A global sensibility, a universal dream,
    a <a href="https://octopus.boo">brotherhood/sisterhood</a>
    vision to repopulate the world with vital,
    <a href="https://p9e.page/fireflies">fresh beings</a>,
    to find the place inside that is sustaining and renewing and to give it forth abundantly.
    A certain spirit of destiny breakthroughs--something different previously unsuspected.
    Diving for the eternal waters, and here they are if they are called in at full power.
    The one given the task to refocus the shared aspiration to bring us all together.
    You have an utterly engaging quality that cannot be denied once it fully arises,
    with the most memorable of touches and looks.
    The presence of the Great Goddess force at every level,
    <a href="https://webmural.com">accessible</a> if dreamed up and invited in.
    The cracking through at the peak time and place.
    All is revitalized. Everything forgotten comes on the spiral to the next octave and is released into the celebration of being.
